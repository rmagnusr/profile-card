## Overview
This was my third project. For the first time I have to work a lot with displays and was a little hard than I thought. I spent 6 hours on this and could do everything without google or a community, only me and my notes, I wanted to prove myself that I could do. 

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that coding is painstaking work. After an hour of work, I had to start over, doing it step by step so I wouldn't skip steps and be able to see my code falling into place.

### Continued development

I realized that I need to study a little more CSS. When I do projects I feel that I learn much more than with classes. So I need to put into practice everything I've seen.
